## Experience 
🏗️


## Projects 

### Automatic recommendations of preparatory math courses 

[Detailed article](https://sriramswaminathan.com/technical/readysetmath/) \| [YouTube demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USG7Er_YHTM)

A website that delivers randomized math tests for each student and uses a custom algorithm to send personalized recommendations via email based on their results. This was a group project @ Maastricht University. 

- Implemented recommendation algorithm based on custom priority scores 
- Created no code-dashboard to help professors analyze all students results (.csv sent in email)
- Contributed to website creation, question generation logic, email delivery and overall debugging
