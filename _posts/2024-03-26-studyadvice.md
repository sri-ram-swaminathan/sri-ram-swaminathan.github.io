This is the advice I wish somebody gave me when I started to study all those years ago. I hope this can add some value for you.  

# General 
- Good sleep (~ 8 hours) is non-negotiable. This is when you consolidate the day's learning and build long-term memory.
- Be consistent with your studies. Discipline v/s Intelligence is like Tortoise v/s Hare. All-nighters are worth 0 extra points.
- Courses in general aren't stand-alone; they build on previous knowledge. It doesn't make sense to half-ass anything you know will be required later.
- Learn in public. Don't just consume, create. Write blogs and cheat sheets. Make the material you wish you had when you started.
- Taking a break is crucial for peak performance. Schedule down time and be intentional about not working. Work hard and play hard.
- Emphasize knowledge over credentials. It's important to have strong fundamentals. Also, don't find shortcuts in learning, good things take time.


# Study 
*"What I cannot create, I do not understand"- Richard P Feynman*
- Make a schedule for learning. List what you need to know, resources, and how much time you'll devote. Spend some time in meta-learning.
- Carve out some time daily for studying; do this in a place with the least distractions. It's harder to slack off in a place where others are learning, like a library. 
- Look at the final exam **before** the course starts. Helps prime you for the course—how and what. Start learning as early as possible.
- Understanding the content =/= replicating it. Close the book and write it out yourself. Teach a friend what you (think you) know.
- Active recall and spaced repetition are your friends.
- Learn with friends towards the end. They can help find pitfalls, bring up good issues, and share their resources. Teaching a weaker student will make you much stronger.
- Summarize. It helps you hone in on the most important stuff. Can you fit a semester in an A4? A chapter in 3 sentences?
- Doing > Reading. Learn theory until you can start solving problems, then let problem-solving lead back to more theory.
- Clear your doubts as soon as you can. Gaps in knowledge also build upon themselves, albeit in a harmful way.

# Exam 
- Try using a pencil, you can erase your garbage answers. 
- Spend some time scanning the test. It gives you an idea of what you know & don't, where to spend more time & where not. Understand the points per question and optimize to get maximum marks, given time constraints. 
- Do the easy questions first. It helps build confidence and warm you up for harder tasks.
- Think like the examiner ; (i) write neatly (ii) box / circle final answer (iii) show your work and explain your thought process with notes, partial marks > no marks 
- Never leave an exam early. Chances are you've made some silly mistakes, find them and deal with them when you can. Once completed, make your test more legible to read.  

# Miscellaneous 
- Nobody will care about your grades, unless they are bad. Get 85% on all courses, maintain close to a 4 GPA without over-study or under-study. Use your limited time well, do things in the real world. Get internships & research projects, contribute to open source, improve a library, etc. 
- Invest time in making & maintaining relationships with people. The word of a professor / recruiter can open doors otherwise inaccessible. 
- Write out results while running in a text file and ensure you commit your changes. 
- With regards to thesis : (i) pick a topic you know you can finish in 30% of the time, you'll probably make a poor estimate of how long it'll take & spill over anyways (ii) try to limit risks / aspects you have no control over, atleast factor them in your estimation ; (a) robotics (b) data mining (iii) "even bad results are results" is a blatant lie, on that note don't falsify results  

I enjoy myself the most while studying when I solve a challenging problem or have a Eureka moment finally understanding a topic. While teachers can help a lot, most of the work and the reward is left to the learner. Don’t shy away from putting in the hours.

While each of these ideas can work in isolation, a lot of them complement each other. These were a few things that helped me, and I hope they help you too. Remember to experiment and stick with what works for you. Happy learning :)
