The biggest takeaway is to make consistent, sustainable efforts. Don't make black (none) / white (only workout) efforts; aim for gray.

### 1. Nutrition üçä
- Avoid ultra-processed food.
- Eating good quality (home-cooked, natural produce) food is paramount.
- Non-starchy vegetables like spinach and broccoli have almost zero sugar. Can be binge eaten.
- Consume carbohydrates in the morning or before exercise; reduces their impact on sugar levels.
- Plants have lesser protein and amino acids compared to meat.
- Avoid sodas and artificial fruit juices; fructose overload.
- Avoid being over-nourished; okay to do if you are eating right.
- Having a bad diet hurts the metabolism, but over-optimizing on diet will not impact longevity.


### 2. Sleep üåô
- 8-10 hours is the number we are hardwired for from years of evolution; anything less or more is a red flag.
- Identify your chronotype (morning bird or night owl).
- Keep a fixed waking time and be consistent with it, especially on weekends.
- Make your room 100% dark or use eye blinds. Little to no lights (bright lights, alarm, LED).
- Avoid screens 1 hour before bed.
- Cool temperature and hot showers before sleep help.
- Exercising 2-3 hours before helps build "sleep pressure"; napping in the afternoon takes away "sleep pressure."
- Avoid anxiety-inducing content before you sleep.

### 3. Exercise üí™
- 3 hours/week of Zone 2 work: can talk in full sentences but barely (cycle, jog).
- 1-2 VO2 max/week: 4 min hard ‚Üí 4 min easy x 4-6 reps.
- Farmer carry + kettlebell holds (1 minute at full body weight 1/2 + 1/2) + dead hang from pull-up bar + rows.
- Focus on the down movements of weightlifting exercises.
- Squats + step-ups + walking.
- Fix posture imbalances, running form, and balance before you start to work out.
- Stretch for 2 hours/week; combine this with breathwork.
- Toe stretching since feet are cooped up in shoes.
- Primal (functional) workouts: push, pull, twist, squat, hinge, lunge, gait (walk, jog, run).
