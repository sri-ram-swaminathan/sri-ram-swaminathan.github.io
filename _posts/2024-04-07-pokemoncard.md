Growing up, I had a Pokemon card collection. The very good cards were hard to come by and it was near impossible to catch them all ! Now however .. :) I can finally complete my collection (well sort of).

![Card](/assets/img/pokemon/1.jpg)
A card created using my code !

I made this as part of my final project for [CS50 Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/). The input prompt looks as follows. After selecting either option the appropriate card is created in ~10 seconds. If the user is unsure, then a random pokemon of their requested type is generated.

The code in action

I use support from [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/), [pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [pokebase](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokebase) in the project. The main logic works on 3 functions. All these functions accept string inputs.

```
def pokemon_finder(type):  
    try:  
        # load the data from the website  
        data = requests.get(f"https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/type/{type}").json()  
        # find the list of pokemons for that type and pick a random one  
        n = len(data["pokemon"])  
        name_i = data["pokemon"][random.randint(0, n)]["pokemon"]["name"]  
        return name_i  
    # handles invalid types  
    except ValueError:  
        return False
```

-   **pokemon_finder(type)** : It accepts one pokemon type as input. It then loads all the data of that particular type from the pokeapi website as a json file. It then returns the name of a random pokemon of that particular type.

```
def pokemon_image(pokemon_i):  
    try:  
        # load the data from the pokemon's website  
        data = requests.get(pokemon_i.url).json()  
        # find the pokemon's first type  
        type = data["types"][0]["type"]["name"]  
        # make a new image object, and import the correct base image  
        card = Image.open(f"./base/{type}.png")  
        card = card.convert("RGBA")  
        # extract the pokemon's image  
        pic = requests.get(pokemon_i.sprites.front_default).content  
        # convert it into an Image object  
        image = Image.open(BytesIO(pic))  
        image = image.convert("RGBA")  
        image = image.resize((345, 228))  
        # paste this image in the correct location and size  
        card.paste(image, (39, 63), image)  
        card.save("card.png")  
        return True  
    # handles pokemon that don't exist  
    except KeyError:  
        return False
```
-   **pokemon_image(pokemon_i) :** It accepts a pokemonâ€™s name as input. It finds out the pokemonâ€™s type and opens the corresponding (empty) card. It extracts the default pokemon sprite and pastes it on the card. It then saves the card as a png.

```
def pokemon_writer(pokemon_i):  
    try:  
        # collect some parameters from the pokemon object  
        name_w = pokemon_i.name

        id_w = pokemon_i.id  
        height_w = pokemon_i.height  
        # collect some paramaters from the website

        draw.text((65, 378.5), moves_1, font=font2, fill=(0, 0, 0))

        card.paste(weakness_image, (47, 513), weakness_image)  
        card.paste(resistance_image, (124, 513), resistance_image)  
        card.save("card.png")

        return False
```

-   **pokemon_writer(pokemon_i) :** It accepts a pokemonâ€™s name as input. It then extracts the name, weight, height, id, type and hp. It extracts 2 random moves from the pokemonâ€™s arsenal (no 2 cards will be entirely the same, even of the same pokemon !). It then finds out the pokemonâ€™s weakness and resistance (if any) and converts them to images. As a final step it sets the fonts and writes out all this information onto the card that was saved last time.

And just like that we go from a string input to a pokemon card png ! I had lots of fun and learnt to work with json files and images in Python. While this is a good project, there is still room for improvement, in particular :

-   The final card produced does not show the damage that each attack deals (a crucial feature of pokemon cards), a feature that was missing with pokeAPI. A description of the move is also missing.
-   The hp of the pokemon is different from the one shown in the actual pokemon cards.
-   The stage of the pokemonâ€™s evolution along with the previous stageâ€™s (if exists) sprite is mising.
-   Small descriptions(text) of the pokemon are missing.
-   The program also takes about 5â€“10 seconds to run. I want to reduce the run time.

The entire source code for the project can be found [here](https://github.com/sri-ram-swaminathan/CS50P-Final-Project).

A short YouTube tutorial can be found [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?si=c2cu77NYoDbCvqvn&v=7vTrzvf29ZI&feature=youtu.be).

P.S. : When I run this code on CS50â€™s codespace (online), it works. When I try to run it on my local machine, Iâ€™m running into a few errors. I would appreciate it a lot if you could help me fix this (that way I can add instructions to run this code on any system ) ðŸ˜„
