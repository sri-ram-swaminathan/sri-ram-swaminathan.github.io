"You ask me if an ordinary person—by studying hard—would get to be able to imagine these things like I imagine. Of course. I was an ordinary person who studied hard. There's no miracle people. It just happens they got interested in this thing, and they learned all this stuff. They're just people. There's no talent or special miracle ability to understand quantum mechanics or a miracle ability to imagine electromagnetic fields that comes without practice and reading and learning and study. So if you take an ordinary person who's willing to devote a great deal of time and study and work and thinking and mathematics, then he's become a scientist." - Richard P Feynman

अब राजा का बेटा राजा नहीं बनेगा ... अब राजा वही बनेगा जो हकदार होगा. - Anand sir in the movie Super 30

Outwork everyone. - Kobe Bryant 

I had no fear when it came to basketball. What I mean by that is:  if I wanted to implement something new into my game, I’d see it and try incorporating it immediately. I wasn’t scared of missing, or looking bad, or being embarrassed. That’s because I always kept the long game in my mind. I always focused on the fact that I had to try something to get it, and once I got it, I’d have another tool in my arsenal. If the price was a lot of work and a few missed shots, I was ok with that. - Kobe Bryant 

The time to fix the roof is when the sun is shining. - John F Kennedy

# Wholesome

[8 ways that money can buy happiness](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/danielgilbert/files/if-money-doesnt-make-you-happy.nov-12-20101.pdf): 

- buy more experiences and fewer material goods; we adapt to experiences slower and revisit (look forward) experiences more fondly & more often
- use your money to benefit others and not yourself; buying a first class plan ticket for somebody you care about > buying a first class plane ticket for yourself, we are bad at predicting how much spending on others affects us  
- buy many small pleasures instead of few large ones; frequent doses of lovely things > infrequent does of lovelier things, bi-weekly merry-go-round leads to more happiness than annual roller coaster
- appreciate the mundane joys of daily life; wealthy individuals lose this with constant exposure to luxury and are worse off for it
- delay consumption; happiness from having the thing + happiness from waiting for it
- think about what you're not thinking about; a beach home means ocean breeze and mosquitoes a plenty, a view of the ocean and meeting plumbers on weekends, factor in the day-to-day 
- beware of comparison shopping; don't overstate the differences and understate the similarities
- pay close attention to the happiness of others; are people who bought said thing indeed happier for it?

# By yours truly 

I will build that castle, but today I lay a brick. 

If I don't believe in myself, nobody else will. If I believe in myself, I don't need anybody else to. All it takes is you.
