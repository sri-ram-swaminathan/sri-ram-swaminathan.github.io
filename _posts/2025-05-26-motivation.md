"You ask me if an ordinary person—by studying hard—would get to be able to imagine these things like I imagine. Of course. I was an ordinary person who studied hard. There's no miracle people. It just happens they got interested in this thing, and they learned all this stuff. They're just people. There's no talent or special miracle ability to understand quantum mechanics or a miracle ability to imagine electromagnetic fields that comes without practice and reading and learning and study. So if you take an ordinary person who's willing to devote a great deal of time and study and work and thinking and mathematics, then he's become a scientist." - Richard P Feynman

I wasn’t scared of missing, or looking bad, or being embarrassed. That’s because I always kept the long game in my mind. I always focused on the fact that I had to try something to get it, and once I got it, I’d have another tool in my arsenal. If the price was a lot of work and a few missed shots, I was ok with that. 

The time to fix the roof is when the sun is shining.

# By yours truly 

I will build that castle, but today I lay a brick. 

If I don't believe in myself, nobody else will. If I believe in myself, I don't need anybody else to. All it takes is you.
