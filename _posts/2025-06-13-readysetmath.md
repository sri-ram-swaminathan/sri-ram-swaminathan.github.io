> This is detailed explanation of my first research project as part of my Master's @ Maastricht University. This was a group project, consisting of 6 members, completed in one semester.  

# Problem statement 

Students entering a Master's program often have varied mathematical backgrounds, making it challenging to ensure adequate preparation and course placement. A self-assessment (written test) is currently used to evaluate their skills and guide module placement, along with manual, personalized course recommendations. While helpful, this process is time-consuming. 

This goal is to develop an automated system that generates personalized learning recommendations to each student, and provides the teaching staff with insights about the students. 

# Final design


## Test questions 

## Recommendation algorithm

## Output and delivery 

## Teacher dashboard

# Where do we go from here? 

While our solution is fully functional and helps many people, there are a few shortcomings that need to be addressed in future versions: 

- Everybody sees the same number of questions:  
- Binary marks only (0/1):
- No hand written inputs:
- Rule based recommendations:
- No order between topics:
