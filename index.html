<a href="https://youtu.be/rEq1Z0bjdwc?si=iO_qPAG-NmHx5n2Z"> Hello There, </a>
<br>
<br>
My name is Sriram. I'm currently in the second year of my Master's in Data Science at Maastricht University, Netherlands. I'm a Computer Vision intern at Statistics Netherlands for the next 6 months :) 
<br>
<br>
I consider myself a detective 🕵🏽‍♂️, using statistical analysis powered by computer programming to uncover hidden insights from the messy world of data.  
<br>
<br>
When I am not hunched over a laptop you can find me engrossed in (i) animals (ii) books (iii) football (iv) art ...
<br>
<br>
Currently I am : 
<ul>
    <li>Applying computer vision to count trees 🌳</li>
    <li>Learning to cook</li>
    <li>Trying to stick to my New Year's Resolutions</li>
</ul>
